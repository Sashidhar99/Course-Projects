**Project-1: Hospital Database System**

I designed a hospital database system to manage patients, staff, appointments, billing, and inventory. The system includes structured tables with well-defined relationships (one-to-many, many-to-many) and SQL queries to retrieve key insights like appointment history and total billing. This database helps hospitals streamline operations, improve efficiency, and enhance patient care.

**Project-2: Analytic Solution of Calgary Traffic Incidents**
This project analyzes Calgaryâ€™s traffic incident data to uncover key trends. Using Power BI, I visualized total incidents, peak hours, high-risk locations, and response times through bar graphs, heatmaps, and pie charts. The insights help improve traffic management and emergency response strategies.

**Project-3: Cloud Architecture for Airports Operations â€œAeroCloud**

In this project, I developed a cloud-based architecture for smart airport operations. I integrated data from IoT devices, biometrics, flight APIs, and retail systems to enable real-time monitoring and decision-making. The data pipeline was built using Azure services like IoT Hub, Data Lake, Stream Analytics, and Synapse. This architecture helps airports enhance efficiency, security, and traveler experience through a data-driven approach.

**Azure-DP203 :Data Engineering on Microsoft Azure**
This project showcases my hands-on practice with Azure data engineering tools while preparing for the DP-203 certification. I completed multiple labs focusing on data ingestion, transformation, and storage using services like Azure Data Lake, Data Factory, Synapse Analytics, and Databricks. I documented each lab with step-by-step guides and insights. These exercises strengthened my skills in building scalable data pipelines and managing data solutions in the cloud.
