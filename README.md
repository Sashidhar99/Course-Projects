**Project-1: Hospital Database System**

I designed a hospital database system to manage patients, staff, appointments, billing, and inventory. The system includes structured tables with well-defined relationships (one-to-many, many-to-many) and SQL queries to retrieve key insights like appointment history and total billing. This database helps hospitals streamline operations, improve efficiency, and enhance patient care.

**Project-2: Analytic Solution of Calgary Traffic Incidents**
This project analyzes Calgaryâ€™s traffic incident data to uncover key trends. Using Power BI, I visualized total incidents, peak hours, high-risk locations, and response times through bar graphs, heatmaps, and pie charts. The insights help improve traffic management and emergency response strategies.
