**Project-1: Hospital Database System**

I designed a hospital database system to manage patients, staff, appointments, billing, and inventory. The system includes structured tables with well-defined relationships (one-to-many, many-to-many) and SQL queries to retrieve key insights like appointment history and total billing. This database helps hospitals streamline operations, improve efficiency, and enhance patient care.

**Project-2: Analytic Solution of Calgary Traffic Incidents**
This project analyzes Calgaryâ€™s traffic incident data to uncover key trends. Using Power BI, I visualized total incidents, peak hours, high-risk locations, and response times through bar graphs, heatmaps, and pie charts. The insights help improve traffic management and emergency response strategies.

**Project-3: Cloud Architecture for Airports Operations â€œAeroCloud**

In this project, I developed a cloud-based architecture for smart airport operations. I integrated data from IoT devices, biometrics, flight APIs, and retail systems to enable real-time monitoring and decision-making. The data pipeline was built using Azure services like IoT Hub, Data Lake, Stream Analytics, and Synapse. This architecture helps airports enhance efficiency, security, and traveler experience through a data-driven approach.

**Azure-DP203 :Data Engineering on Microsoft Azure**
This project showcases my hands-on practice with Azure data engineering tools while preparing for the DP-203 certification. I completed multiple labs focusing on data ingestion, transformation, and storage using services like Azure Data Lake, Data Factory, Synapse Analytics, and Databricks. I documented each lab with step-by-step guides and insights. These exercises strengthened my skills in building scalable data pipelines and managing data solutions in the cloud.

**Azure DP-500: Enterprise Data Analytics on Azure**
This project highlights my practical work from Azure DP-500 labs, focused on designing and implementing enterprise-scale analytics solutions. I worked with Azure Synapse Analytics, Power BI, and Azure Purview to build and optimize analytical models, manage data governance, and create advanced visualizations. The documentation includes lab steps, learnings, and real-world applications of building data-driven solutions for business intelligence.
